With more pet owners prioritizing the well-being of their animals, the demand for effective and safe deworming treatments has risen. Innovations in deworming medications, along with the growing trend of preventive care, are contributing to market expansion. In addition, the rising awareness of zoonotic diseases—diseases that can transfer from animals to humans—has prompted a higher focus on internal deworming to safeguard both pets and owners. As the market for pet care continues to evolve, the internal dewormer segment is expected to witness steady growth, fueled by new product developments, improved formulations, and increasing adoption rates of pet care products. This trend is further supported by the availability of both prescription and over-the-counter deworming solutions, catering to a broad range of pet owners.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>The pet internal dewormer market is expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 6-8% from 2023 to 2030. This growth can be attributed to several factors such as the surge in pet adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic, the increasing awareness of internal parasites like roundworms, hookworms, and tapeworms, and a growing preference for preventive care solutions. The demand for pet deworming products is particularly high in regions like North America and Europe, where pet care expenditures are higher, and the adoption of premium pet care products is on the rise. Furthermore, the expansion of the pet healthcare market in emerging economies is expected to contribute to the global growth of the internal dewormer market. Veterinary professionals are also pushing for regular deworming protocols, which is further propelling the sales of deworming products. The increasing use of e-commerce platforms to purchase pet medications is another key driver, making these products more accessible to pet owners worldwide. Technological advancements in the form of liquid, tablet, and chewable wormers that are easier to administer have also made internal deworming products more attractive to pet parents.The competitive landscape is becoming increasingly fragmented, with a wide variety of players offering a range of deworming solutions, including both generic and branded products. Some prominent market players are investing heavily in research and development to enhance the effectiveness of their formulations and to meet the growing demand for natural and organic pet care products.
